Good work all around.
Nice formatting, straight-forward code, 
  good use of JavaDoc comments.
  
One minor irritation:  Spacing on your for loop (in all of the methods).
Standard practice is to use a single space between words and symbols.
It makes the code more readable for the next person who works with it.

You wrote
     for(int i=1; i < arrayData.length;i++)
Better:
     for (int i = 1; i < arrayData.length; i++)

Overall, very good work.
10/10
